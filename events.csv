"2023-09-02", "Saturday & Sunday, Labor Day Weekend", "Fort Henry Days", "http://forthenrydays.org/", "The Revolutionary war is widely considered to have ended at Yorktown. However, on the frontier borders of this fledgling country, the war was still very much alive, and the small community of Wheeling was struggling to survive continuing conflict with the British and their Native-American allies. For the colonial denizens of Wheeling, hardship was a way of life, and the threat of sudden death was a constant companion. The area’s lone stronghold, Ft. Henry, was the only means of defense for this frontier settlement, and the people of the area depended on it for their very lives. Fort Henry Days is a tribute to Wheeling’s frontier era. Witness history come to life through dramatic battle re-enactments and period correct demonstrations. Return to the time of Betty Zane, Sam McColloch, and Lewis Wetzel. Return to a time where uncommon courage was commonplace."
